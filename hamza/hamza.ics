Since the U.S. liability crisis of the 1980's\, the underwriting cycle has become a central topic in the research agenda of the insurance economics literature. Virtually all existing studies have used accounting data to study cycles in loss ratios\, which is a measure of profitability\, and not a measure of price. This is because insurance companies typically do not report price and quantity separately. Although the cyclical patterns in profitability are suspected to be inherited from those in prices\, there is\, to the best of knowledge\, no evidence that premium rates exhibit a cyclical behavior. Further\, recent studies argue that insurance cycles do not exist at all. They question the relevance of AR(2) processes\, which is the usual methodology used to identify cycles in profitability\, and argue that they can lead to the detection of spurious cycles in what could simply be random walks.\n The present work addresses two related questions. Namely\, do insurance prices exhibit a cyclical behavior? and in case they do\, how can these patterns be detected in a reliable way? Based on a simulation study\, the paper investigates the performance of difference cycle detection methods\, and finds that a hybrid neural network architecture combining both convolutional and recurrent layers achieves a high accuracy of 98.06%. This architecture is then applied to market premium rates from the Brazilian automobile insurance industry for a large number of different risk profiles. The results provide strong evidence that premiums for most risk profiles exhibit a cyclical behavior.\n\nFurther details: https://owars.info\n\nThe zoom link will be available 15 minutes before the seminar on the following link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExsaDqghA0zJZZ-V4mBIT50W3_jmDJznfirjyz-EzC8/edit?ts=5e9f9a01\n
