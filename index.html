  Inter-order relations between moments of a Student t distribution, with an application to L_p-quantiles
<br> 
<b>Abstract:</b>
In this work we  focus on a class of risk measures denoted  L_p-quantiles, which represent a class of generalized quantiles defined through an asymmetric p-power loss function. In particular, we show that for a Student t distribution with n degrees of freedom,  the L_{n−j+1}-quantile and the L_j -quantile coincide at any confidence level τ in (0, 1). This result is based on inter-order formulas for partial and complete moments of the Student t distribution. We show how the partial moment of order n − j about any real value m can be expressed in terms of the partial moment of order j − 1 for j in {1, . . . , n}. Closed form expressions for the complete moments are also established.

      <br> <details>
        <summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
       We study a dynamic Stackelberg differential game between a buyer and a seller of insurance policies in a spectrally negative Levy framework, in which both parties are ambiguous about the intensity and severity of insurable losses. Both the buyer and seller aim to maximize their expected wealth, plus a penalty term that reflects ambiguity, over an exogenous random horizon. Under a mean-variance premium principle and a quadratic penalty for ambiguity, we obtain the equilibrium in closed form. Our main results show that the buyer’s robust optimal indemnity is a coinsurance with proportion less than one-half, which increases (resp. decreases) as the buyer (resp. seller) becomes more ambiguity averse. Also we show that the seller’s robust optimal premium rule equals the net premium under the buyer’s optimally distorted probability, which is the buyer’s “best hope,” and it exceeds the actuarially fair premium under the seller’s optimally distorted probability measure so is, thereby, acceptable to the seller

        <td class = "title"> Generalized PELVE and applications to risk measures
      <br> <details>
        <summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
         The continuing evolution of insurance and banking regulation has
raised interest in the calibration of different risk measures associated
with suitable confidence levels. In particular, Li and Wang (2019)
have introduced a probability equivalent level (called PELVE) for the
replacement of Value at Risk with Conditional Value at Risk.
In this talk, we propose a new tool (generalized PELVE, or
g-PELVE) that extends PELVE to more general pairs of monotone risk
measures. Conditions for the existence
and uniqueness of g-PELVE and additional properties for specific families of risk measures are discussed.
A study of Generalized Pareto Distributions reveals
an interesting correspondence between PELVE and g-PELVE, and explores
their relationship with the tail index. An empirical application
illustrates the usefulness of (g-)PELVE in characterizing tail behavior
not only for individual asset returns, but also for possible portfolio
combinations.
Based on a joint work with Anna Maria Fiori.

        <td class = "title"> Testing for more positive expectation dependence with application to model comparison and autocalibrated models.
      <br> <details>
        <summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
        Modern data science tools are effective to produce predictions that strongly correlate with responses.
Model comparison can therefore be based on the strength of dependence between responses and their predictions.
Positive expectation dependence turns out to be attractive in that respect. 
The present talk proposes an effective testing procedure for this dependence concept and applies it to compare two models.
A simulation study is performed to evaluate the performances of the proposed testing procedure.
Empirical illustrations using insurance loss data demonstrate the relevance of the approach
for model selection in supervised learning.
The most positively expectation dependent predictor can then be autocalibrated to obtain its balance-corrected version that appears to be
optimal with respect to Bregman, or forecast dominance.
Under autocalibration, it is shown that Lorenz curve and concentration curve coincide and that the integral of the concentration
curve is equivalent to Gini coefficient.

        <td class = "title">Insurance Discrimination and Pricing Fairness
      <br> <details>
        <summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
On the issue of insurance discrimination, a grey area in regulation has resulted from the growing use of big data analytics by insurance companies – direct discrimination is prohibited, but indirect discrimination using proxies or more complex and opaque algorithms can be tolerated without restrictions. This phenomenon has recently attracted the attention of insurance regulators all over the world, and stricter insurance discrimination regulations are being discussed and considered by regulators. Meanwhile, various fairness criteria and fair machine learning algorithms have been proposed and flourish in the machine learning literature with the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) in the past decade, which mostly focus on classification decisions. In this presentation, I will firstly review social and economic principles that can be used to assess the appropriateness of insurance discrimination. I will then introduce the fairness criteria that are potentially applicable to insurance pricing, match them with different levels of potential and existing anti-discrimination regulations, and implement them into a series of existing and newly proposed anti-discrimination insurance pricing models.  Finally, I will compare the outcome of different models from the perspectives of both group fairness and individual fairness and show the cost of fairness.      </details></td>

        <td class = "title"> Change of measure techniques for scaled insurance cash flows
      <br> <details>
        <summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
       Incidental policyholder behavior, including free policy conversion and stochastic retirement, may have a significant impact on the market value of a life insurance contract; consequently, models should account for this. However, the inclusion of incidental policyholder behavior typically leads to duration effects and thus an increase in computational complexity. In this talk, I show how change of measure techniques can be used to conveniently deal with this added layer of complication.

        <td class = "title">Flexible annuity designs meeting individuals’ longevity risk appetite (or unawareness) 
      <br> <details>
        <summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
        Despite the growing need for individuals to protect themselves from the longevity risk to which their assets will be exposed after retirement, the demand for products offering longevity guarantees, namely annuities, remains low. Possible reasons include the cost of guarantees and the rigidity of the traditional annuity design, which implies an irreversible decision at issue. This contrasts with the perspective of individuals who, because of their risk appetite or unawareness, seem to prefer to avoid non-revisable decisions, at least in the early stages of their post-retirement life, and to retain their longevity risk up to some higher age. 
Flexibility in the annuity design could, at least partially, meet the prevailing individuals’ attitude. Flexibility can be introduced in different ways. We focus on two solutions. First, the guarantees can be relaxed, and the related costs can be reduced, by allowing the benefit amount to fluctuate (up or down) according to a given mortality/longevity experience. Second, instead of an upfront loading at issue, periodic fees could be charged, as they are more suitable to support a revision of the arrangement after issue. While the literature includes already several contributions on mortality/longevity-linked benefits, a pricing structure based on periodic fees has received little attention so far. We develop a discussion in this respect, considering mortality/longevity-linked annuities

      <br> <details>
        <summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
      A Distributional (Single) Index Model (DIM) is a semiparametric model for distributional regression, that is, estimation of conditional distributions given covariates. The method is a combination of classical single- index models for the estimation of the conditional mean of a response given covariates, and isotonic distributional regression. The model for the index is parametric, whereas the conditional distributions are estimated nonparametrically under a stochastic ordering constraint. We show consistency of our estimators and apply them to a highly challenging dataset on the length of stay (LoS) of patients in intensive care units. We use the model to provide skillful and calibrated probabilistic predictions for the LoS of individual patients, which outperform the available methods in the literature.

      <br> <details>
        <summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
    Artificial Intelligence is often characterized in terms of “solving intelligence” or building machines that outperform humans at most economically meaningful work.  But for scientific, economic, as well as societal reasons, this paradigm is likely to give way to a more design-focused paradigm of creating human-machine hybrid intelligence systems. This talk will sketch the Hybrid Intelligence paradigm, and discuss various ways in which the needed field of Hybrid Intelligence engineering must adopt traits characteristic of the actuarial profession:  a respect for data limitations, an acknowledgment of the need to integrate algorithmic indications with local knowledge and informed judgment; and an ethos of ethical behavior and public service. The discussion will be motivated by examples from insurance and other domains.

        <td class = "title">     An Effective Simulation Scheme for the Valuation of Large Heterogeneous Insurance Portfolios

      
      <br> <details>
        <summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
Insurance policies are mostly individual specific, as policyholders possess different risk characteristics and choose different policy options to meet their needs. Thus, the probability distributions that underlie the insurance claims are policy specific and complex, as opposed to the common parametric distributions. As a result, calculating the quantities of interest (e.g.  premiums, liabilities, etc.) can only be done via stochastic simulations individually. Moreover, in reality an insurance portfolio contains hundreds of thousands of policies. In other words, we are dealing with a very large and highly heterogeneous insurance portfolio. To obtain any quantity of interest via simulation across the entire portfolio is extremely time consuming and is very often prohibitive. In this talk, we propose an effective simulation scheme that only involves the simulation of a very small number of the policies in the portfolio. The first step is to select this small set of policies using a population sampling technique, i.e. the Delta method, so that the entire portfolio is well represented by the selected policies. A tailor-made simulation algorithm is applied to those representative policies. We then identify a policy specific quantity or summary statistics that well describe the information from a policy (policy attributes and claims) and introduce a model (surrogate model) that links the quantity/statistics to the quantity of interest we intend to calculate. The surrogate model is estimated using the representative policies and is then used for extrapolation (to calculate the quantity for the rest of the policies). We illustrate this simulation scheme with two very different examples. One is the valuation and hedging of a variable annuity (VA) portfolio and the other is on the calculation of the Bayesian premiums of an auto insurance portfolio.

        <td class = "title">Robust Decisions for Heterogeneous Agents via Certainty Equivalents
      <br> <details>
        <summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
     We study the problem of a planner who resolves risk-return trade-offs - like financial investment decisions - on behalf of a collective of agents with heterogeneous risk preferences. The planner's objective is a two-stage utility functional where an outer utility function is applied to the distribution of the agents' certainty equivalents from a given decision. Assuming lognormal risks and heterogeneous power utility preferences for the agents, we characterize optimal behavior in a setting where the planner can let each agent choose between different options from a fixed menu of possible decisions, leading to a grouping of the agents by risk preferences. These optimal decision menus are derived first for the case where the planner knows the distribution of preferences exactly and then for a case where he faces uncertainty about this distribution, only having access to upper and lower bounds on agents' relative risk aversion. Finally, we provide tight bounds on the welfare loss from offering a finite menu of choices rather than fully personalized decisions.

      <br> <details>
        <summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
The goal of Planted Machine Learning is to discover and learn low dimensional structures that can get more complex along a planted path. I will introduce Random Planted Forest –  an algorithm we have recently developed that seems to be competitive with state-of-the-art machine learning predictors with respect to accuracy while having favourable interpretability properties.  In the second part of the talk, we will contrast local explanations like SHAP values to the interpretation of global structures and by doing so touching topics on causality, fairness and variable importance.

        <td class = "title">A Multivariate Spatiotemporal Model for County-Level Mortality Data in the Contiguous United States
      <br> <details>
        <summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
       Using a number of modern predictive modeling methods, we seek to understand the factors that drive mortality in the contiguous United States. The mortality data we use is indexed by county and year as well as grouped into 18 different age bins. We propose a model that adds two important contributions to existing mortality studies. First, instead of building mortality models separately by age or treating age as a fixed covariate, we treat age as a random effect. This is an improvement over previous models because it allows the model in one age group to borrow strength and information from other age groups that are nearby. The result is a multivariate spatiotemporal model and is estimated using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA). Second, we utilize Gaussian Processes to create nonlinear covariate effects for predictors such as unemployment rate, race, and education level. This allows for a more flexible relationship to be modeled between mortality and these important predictors. Understanding that the United States is expansive and diverse, we also allow for many of these effects to vary by location. The amount of flexibility of our model in how predictors relate to mortality has not been used in previous mortality studies and will result in a more accurate model and a more complete understanding of the factors that drive mortality. Both the multivariate nature of the model as well as the non-linear predictors that have an interaction with space will advance the study of mortality beyond what has been done previously and will allow us to better examine the often complicated relationships between the predictors and mortality in different regions.

    <td class = "title"> Statistical methods for understanding and decoding evolutionary processes

<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
Two of my major research interests are statistical methods for
(a) understanding genetic diversity within populations, and
(b) decoding mutational processes in cancer evolution.
In this talk I will describe the core probability models in these two areas of molecular evolution.
In particular I plan to emphasize recent developments and challenges that could serve as foundations for future collaborations.

    <td class = "title"> Optimal collective financial decision making

<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
In this talk, we will discuss optimal portfolio choice for an agent (e.g., a social planner) who aims to maximize a multivariate objective such as an expected multivariate utility. We first relate this problem to a problem of cost-efficient allocation, which consists in finding the cheapest multidimensional payoff achieving a given joint distribution. We then characterize the optimal portfolio in a general setting, provide a numerical procedure to obtain an optimal allocation, and derive explicit expressions in the Gaussian case. We discuss desired properties for the multivariate objective function in order to ensure that optimal portfolios are not comonotonic. Important potential applications, such as reducing systemic risk or estimating the cost of ``constrained diversification," are also examined. This is a joint work with Luca De Gennaro and Steven Vanduffel.

    <td class = "title"> Geometric risk measures for risk management and semi-parametric estimation of multivariate extreme expectiles
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
Using the geometric representation of risk measures does not provide as straightforward interpretation of how risky a position is, compared to using distribution-based risk measures. However, in this presentation, we will see how they can bring insightful information and help assessing multivariate risks. Moreover, special attention will be brought to providing a semi-parametric estimator for multivariate extreme expectiles. Illustrations using simulated and real data will be provided.

    <td class = "title"> Linking risk management under expected shortfall to loss-averse behavior (joint work with Thai Nguyen)
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
We introduce and solve an optimal asset allocation problem under a weighted expected shortfall (WES) constraint, which contains the risk management problem under an expected shortfall constraint of Basak and Shapiro (2001) as a special case. Furthermore, we link our risk management problem under the WES constraint with an optimal asset allocation with a multiple-reference-based preference (MRBP) and find that the optimal wealth with MRBP owns the same form as the optimal solution under the WES constraint. For the degenerate case with a fixed reference level, we are able to determine the critical
 maximal allowed expected shortfall constraint as a function of the loss aversion parameters to achieve equivalence.  It is interesting to observe that, while no equivalence can be in general obtained between the WES and the MRBP solution, the optimal terminal wealth of the WES can be made to coincide with the
 MRBP terminal wealth in the most favorable and in the worst market states. In addition, we carry out a general equilibrium analysis in the presence of a WES/MRBP risk manager.

    <td class = "title"> Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Risk Modelling
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
We consider the problem where a modeller conducts sensitivity analysis of a model consisting of random input factors, a corresponding random output of interest, and a baseline probability measure. The modeller seeks to understand how the model (the distribution of the input factors as well as the output) changes under a stress on the output's distribution. Specifically, for a stress on the output random variable, we derive the unique stressed distribution of the output that is closest in the Wasserstein distance to the baseline output's distribution and satisfies the stress. We further derive the stressed model, including the stressed distribution of the inputs, which can be calculated in a numerically efficient way from a set of baseline Monte Carlo samples.
The proposed reverse sensitivity analysis framework is model-free and allows for stresses on the output such as (i) the mean and variance, (ii) any distortion risk measure including the Value-at-Risk and Expected-Shortfall, and (iii) expected utility type constraints, thus making the reverse sensitivity analysis framework suitable for risk models.

    <td class = "title"> The Changing Spatial Dependence in Flood Risk: A Loss Occurrence Study in the United States
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
Flood represents one of the costliest and most disruptive natural disasters in the United States, and the economic losses from flooding are trending upward. While this trend is known to be driven primarily by an increasing population and increasing wealth exposure, climate change is also impacting flood risk in more subtle ways. We merge data on economic flood losses, historical climate, census population, and geological characteristics to explore trends in the spatial dependence of economic flood loss occurrence across 292 hydrobasins from 1979-2018 in the United States. We then fit an autologistic statistical model for flood loss occurrence, control for known covariates, and quantify climate drivers of flood risk occurrence. We show empirically that measures of spatial clustering and dependence have been decreasing over the study period, and through a simulation study with our statistical model we document how these trends are caused in part by a changing climate, and are expected to continue. This work is joint with Mathieu Boudreault at UQAM, David Carozza at UQAM, and Kejia Yu at WFU.

    <td class = "title"> The Role of Longevity Annuities in Different Socioeconomic Classes: A Canadian Case Study
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
Longevity annuity is a deferred annuity where payments start very late in life, i.e. well after the normal retirement age, 65. By transferring the risk of outliving retirement savings at high ages to annuity providers, longevity annuity provides annuitants with enhanced later-life financial security. In this paper, we examine the impact of longevity annuity provision on retirement income planning based on Canadian tax rules and the Canadian retirement system. A dynamic life cycle framework is developed to study welfare increase and consumption pattern changes resulting from the provision of longevity annuities to Canadian retirees. To determine the optimal choices in the life cycle model, we propose a modified general endogenous grid method (GEGM) which addresses the non-differentiability problem arising from realistic tax rules and a realistic retirement system. This life cycle framework and modified GEGM are further applied to explore how individuals in different social classes respond to the access to longevity annuities.

    <td class = "title"> Neural Network Embedding of the Negative Binomial Regression Model for Claim Frequencies
Joint work with Ziyi Li
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
The aim of this paper is to embed the overdispersed Negative Binomial regression model for claim counts into a neural network architecture following the Combined Actuarial Neural Network approach (CANN) approach of Wuthrich and Mertz (2019). The implementation of the blended model is illustrated by a real data application which involves fitting French motor third-party liability (MTPL) insurance data. We demonstrate that the neural net boosting of the Negative Binomial regression model allows us to explore missing interactions of nonmultiplicative type that cannot be captured by the Negative Binomial Regression model.

    <td class = "title"> Social network analytics for supervised fraud detection in insurance and beyond
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
Fraud occurs in the insurance industry when policyholders file claims that are exaggerated or based on intentional damage. In organized crime, such as fraud, social relations are important as they provide access to co-offenders, profitable opportunities and invigorate trust. In this talk, we present a novel approach to detect fraudulent insurance claims using bipartite networks of claims and involved parties that represent the social structures of collaborating fraudsters. We compute fraud scores based on influence from the fraudulent claims in the network and extract features using the fraud scores and the claims’ neighborhood. We combine these network features with the intrinsic features in a supervised model with fraud as the target variable. The high performance of the model with all features indicates that the network features provide valuable information which complements the information contributed by the intrinsic features. The resulting model can be used to flag suspicious claims. We also discuss applications of our proposed method in other areas, such as credit scoring.

    <td class = "title"> An extreme value approach to CoVaR estimation
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
The global financial crisis of 2007-2009 highlighted the crucial role systemic risk plays in ensuring stability of financial markets. Accurate assessment of systemic risk would enable regulators to introduce suitable policies to mitigate the risk as well as allow individual institutions to monitor their vulnerability to market movements. One popular measure of systemic risk is CoVaR. We propose a methodology to estimate CoVaR semi-parametrically within the classical framework of multivariate extreme value theory. According to its definition, CoVaR can be viewed as a high quantile of a conditional distribution where the conditioning event corresponds to large losses of a given institution. We relate this conditional distribution to the tail dependence function. In the estimation procedure, we combine parametric modelling of the tail dependence function to address the issue of data sparsity in the joint tail regions and semi-parametric univariate high quantile estimation techniques. We prove consistency of the estimator, and illustrate its performance via simulation studies and a real data example. This is a joint work with Chen Zhou (Erasmus University) and Menglin Zhou (University of British Columbia).

    <td class = "title"> Detection of insurance price cycles using neural networks
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
The underwriting cycle refers to the repetitive patterns of ups and downs in premium rates of property-liability insurance. Since the U.S. liability crisis of the 1980's, the underwriting cycle has become a central topic in the research agenda of the insurance economics literature. Virtually all existing studies have used accounting data to study cycles in loss ratios, which is a measure of profitability, and not a measure of price. This is because insurance companies typically do not report price and quantity separately. Although the cyclical patterns in profitability are suspected to be inherited from those in prices, there is, to the best of knowledge, no evidence that premium rates exhibit a cyclical behavior. Further, recent studies argue that insurance cycles do not exist at all. They question the relevance of AR(2) processes, which is the usual methodology used to identify cycles in profitability, and argue that they can lead to the detection of spurious cycles in what could simply be random walks.
 The present work addresses two related questions. Namely, do insurance prices exhibit a cyclical behavior? and in case they do, how can these patterns be detected in a reliable way? Based on a simulation study, the paper investigates the performance of difference cycle detection methods, and finds that a hybrid neural network architecture combining both convolutional and recurrent layers achieves a high accuracy of 98.06%. This architecture is then applied to market premium rates from the Brazilian automobile insurance industry for a large number of different risk profiles. The results provide strong evidence that premiums for most risk profiles exhibit a cyclical behavior.

    <td class = "title"> Optimal dividend payment under constraints
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
In this talk we will discuss the problem of optimal dividend rate payment (with a giving ceiling on dividend rates) for a surplus process under the additional constraint of drawdown; that is dividend rates should not decrease more than a given fraction b∈(0,1) of the historical peak. We also address the case in which b=1, this corresponds to a ratcheting constraint on dividends (i.e. the dividend payment rate can never decrease). We maximize the expectation of the discounted cumulative dividend payment up to ruin time. Using the Dynamic Programming Principle, we can show that the optimal value function is the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding two dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. In the case that the surplus follows a Brownian motion and the dividend payment rates have a ratcheting constraint, we find the value function corresponding to one-curve strategies (that are the natural extension to two dimensions of the threshold strategies). In these type of strategies, the curve partitions the state space in two regions: one in which the dividends are paid at the current dividend rate and the other in which the dividend rates increases. Afterwards,we use calculus of variations in order to obtain the best value function among these type of curve strategies. The optimal curve is obtained as the unique solution of an ODE. In the case that the dividend payment rate has a drawdown constraint we  find value functions corresponding to two-curve strategies. In these type of strategies, the two curves partition the state space in three regions:a region in which dividends are paid at b times the historical peak rate (minimum rate allowed), a region (that is located in between the two curves) in which dividend rates are paid at the historical peak and a region in which dividend rates increases above the historical peak. One more time, we use calculus of variations to obtain the best strategy but this time among these two-curves strategies. These optimal two curves are obtained as the unique solution of a system of  ODE's. We  present numerical examples and show how the drawdown case, as b decreases from 1 to 0, approach the (usual) one dimensional problem without constraints on dividend rates (which corresponds to b=0). Additionally, we study the limit problem when the ceiling on dividend rates go to infinity.
    This is a joint work with Hansjoerg Albrecher and Pablo Azcue.

    <td class = "title"> Propagation of cyber incidents in an insurance portfolio
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
In this talk, we propose a general framework to design accumulation scenarios that can be used to anticipate the impact of a massive cyber attack on an insurance portfolio. The aim is also to emphasize the role of countermeasures in stopping the spread of the attack over the portfolio, and to quantify the benefits of implementing such strategies of response. Our approach consists of separating the global dynamic of the cyber event (that can be described through compartmental epidemiological models), the effect on the portfolio, and the response strategy. This general framework allows us to obtain Gaussian approximations for the corresponding processes, and sharp confidence bounds for the losses. A detailed simulation study, which mimics the effects of a Wannacry scenario, illustrates the practical implementation of the
method. Joint work with Olivier Lopez.

    <td class = "title"> The Marginal Cost of Risk and Capital Allocation in a Property and Casualty Insurance Company (with Qiheng Guo and George H. Zanjani)
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
We develop a multi-period profit maximization model for a property and casualty (P&C) insurance company and use it for determining the marginal cost of risk for different lines of business and resulting economic capital allocations. In contrast to previous literature, our model features a loss structure that matches the characteristics of a P&C company, comprising so-called “short-tailed” and “long-tailed” business lines with different expected settlement terms. As one key contribution, our theoretical and numerical results show that lines with different terms are assessed differently, depending on the company’s financial situation.

    <td class = "title"> Multiple-prior valuation of cash flows subject to capital requirements
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
We study market-consistent valuation of liability cash flows motivated by current regulatory frameworks for the insurance industry. Building on the theory on multiple-prior optimal stopping we propose a valuation functional with sound economic properties that applies to any liability cash flow. Whereas a replicable cash flow is assigned the market value of the replicating portfolio, a cash flow that is not fully replicable is assigned a value which is the sum of the market value of a replicating portfolio and a positive margin. The margin is a direct consequence of considering a hypothetical transfer of the liability cash flow from an insurance company to an empty corporate entity set up with the sole purpose to manage the liability run-off, subject to repeated capital requirements, and considering the valuation of this entity from the owner's perspective taking model uncertainty into account. Aiming for applicability, we consider a detailed insurance application and explain how the optimisation problems over sets of probability measures can be cast as simpler optimisation problems over parameter sets corresponding to parameterised density processes appearing in applications.

<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
We study the duration-hedging trades of duration-sensitive strategic investors, i.e., pensions and life insurers. We use longevity shocks to identify their duration-hedging trades. Longevity shocks affect these investors’ liability duration and induce them to adjust their asset duration. When longevity shocks are low (high), they buy more short- (long-) duration stocks and sell more long- (short-) duration stocks. Because prior winners (losers) have shorter (longer) duration, they behave like momentum (contrarian) traders when longevity shocks are low (high). We further verify this channel using capital flows and cross-state longevity variations.

    <td class = "title"> VIX-linked fee analysis via continuous-time Markov chain methods
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
We consider variable annuity (VA) contracts in which the insurance fee is linked to the VIX index and study the impact of the fee structure on the optimal surrender strategy. Approximating the VA account value and the volatility processes by a two-layer continuous-time Markov chain allows us to work with various VIX-linked fee structures and a wide class of stochastic volatility models, thus generalizing the framework of Cui et al. (2017). We discuss a simple condition under which early surrenders are suboptimal, and present a fast algorithm to approximate the value of the VA contract when this condition is not satisfied. Extensive numerical examples are carried out to illustrate the impact of the fee structure on optimal policyholder behaviour.

    <td class = "title">When does portfolio compression reduce systemic risk?
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
We analyse the consequences of portfolio compression on systemic risk. Portfolio compression is a post-trading netting mechanism that reduces gross positions while keeping net positions unchanged and it is part of the financial legislation in the US (Dodd-Frank Act) and in Europe (European Market Infrastructure Regulation). We derive necessary structural conditions for portfolio compression to be harmful and discuss policy implications. In particular, we show that the potential danger of portfolio compression comes from defaults of firms that conduct portfolio compression. If no defaults occur among those firms that engage in compression, then portfolio compression always reduces systemic risk.

    <td class = "title"> S-shaped narrow framing, skewness and the demand for insurance
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
 The existing literature in insurance economics has shown that narrow framing can explain why people buy too little insurance compared to what standard theory predicts. However, there is also ample evidence suggesting people sometimes buy too much insurance. In this paper, we assume S-shaped narrow framing, i.e., the local utility function for evaluating the net insurance payoff is convex in the loss domain but concave in the gain domain, and show that it can reconcile with both insurance puzzles simultaneously. Especially, we show the policyholder under S-shaped narrow framing is more likely to underinsure more negatively skewed risks of loss but to overinsure less negatively skewed risks of loss when only coinsurance is offered. We further characterize the optimal insurance scheme under S-shaped narrow framing while incentive compatibility is satisfied. It contains a straight deductible when the net insurance payoff is negative but partial insurance when the net insurance payoff is positive. This is a joint work with Jiakun Zheng and Yichun Chi.

<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
We present how to enhance classical generalized linear models by neural network features. On the way there, we highlight the traps and pitfalls that need to be avoided to get good statistical models. This includes the non-uniqueness of sufficiently good regression models, the balance property, and representation learning, which brings us back to the concept of the good old generalized linear models.

   <td class = "title">Long-term care insurance financing using home equity release: Evidence from an experimental study<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
We explore new mechanisms to fund long-term care using housing wealth. We conduct and analyze an online experimental survey fielded to a representative sample of 1,200 Chinese homeowners aged 45-64 to assess the potential demand for new financial products that allow individuals to access their housing wealth to buy long-term care insurance. We find that the stated demand for long-term care insurance increases when individuals can use housing wealth in addition to savings to purchase long-term care insurance. Individuals prefer to access housing wealth through a reverse mortgage loan rather than home reversion (a partial sale of housing wealth). Our results inform current policy reforms in China which aim at developing the private market for health and long-term care insurance products.

    <td class = "title">Is Covid-19 a parallel shift of the term structure of mortality?
Implications for annuity pricing <br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
This presentation – which admittedly is rather speculative – examines the financial implications of a sudden shock to mortality on the pricing of pension & life annuities. Now, a textbook approach would suggest that holding interest rates constant, an increase in mortality reduces the discounted value of longevity-contingent claims. Stated simply, life insurance gets expensive and annuities become cheaper. However, if the shock to mortality actually weeds-out the frail and merely advances imminent deaths, then survivors will find that (counter-intuitively) annuities are suddenly dearer. Add plummeting interest rates and depressed equity markets to the mix and soon-to-be retirees might be facing an exceedingly higher "cost of retirement" post 2020.

Technically speaking these matters tie into so-called compensation laws and the convergence of the term structure of (stochastic) mortality at very advanced ages. These matters also relate to the distinction between chronological age versus biological age and the relevant clock for measuring any shocks to mortality.

In sum, this (conjectural) presentation speculates on how to “think” about covid-19 from the perspective of retirement income planning. One thing is for certain, the first-order independence between shocks to mortality (i.e. the insurance measure) and the economy (i.e. the financial measure) can no longer be assumed, even for textbook actuarial models.

    <td class = "title">PELVE: Probability Equivalent Level of VaR and ES
 <br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
Inspired by the recent transition from the 99% Value-at-Risk (VaR) to the 97.5% Expected Shortfall (ES) for internal market risk models in the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), we introduce a new distributional index, the probability equivalence level of VaR and ES (PELVE), which identifies the balancing point for the equivalence between VaR and ES. PELVE enjoys many desirable theoretical properties and it distinguishes heavy-tailed distributions from light-tailed ones via a threshold 2.72. Applying PELVE to financial asset and portfolio data leads to interesting observations that are not captured by VaR or ES alone. For instance, empirical PELVE exhibit unprecedented jumps during the COVID-19 period, which is not the case for VaR or ES. Moreover, the transition from VaR to ES in the FRTB yields an increase in risk capital for single-asset portfolios, but for well-diversified portfolios, the capital requirement remains almost unchanged. This leads to both a theoretical justification and an empirical evidence for that the use of ES rewards portfolio diversification more than the use of VaR. The talk is based on joint work with Hengxin Li (University of California, Berkeley).

    <td class = "title">Claims reserving in non-life insurance: old and new adventures<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
Claims reserving deals with the prediction of the remaining development of reported, open claims (the reported but not settled reserve) and unreported claims (the incurred but not reported reserve). Micro-level or granular reserving approaches the reserving problem by using granular, detailed data on the development of individual claims. In this talk we briefly present recent work on modelling the number of incurred but not reported (ibnr) claims. We continue with presenting a modular, yet interpretable framework for including claim- and policy-specific covariates in reserving models for reported but not settled (rbns) claims. In this framework, reserving models are tailed to the portfolio at hand by adding building blocks for the events (e.g. settlement, payment, …) registered over the lifetime of a claim. This talk concentrates on a specific model structure with three events describing the development of a claim : the time to settlement, the number of payments and the size of each payment. We propose model selection techniques for predictive models adapted for censored data to select the relevant covariates in these models and demonstrate how the selected covariates determine the granularity of our reserving model. We illustrate the method with case studies on real life insurance data sets. These case studies provide new insights in the covariates driving the development of claims and demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the reserving methodology over time.
The talk is based on joint work with Jonas Crevecoeur, Roel Verbelen and Gerda Claeskens.

    <td class = "title">Coherent forecasting age distribution of death counts for multiple populations<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
We consider a compositional data analysis approach to forecasting the age distribution of death counts for multiple populations. When modelling the age distribution of death counts for multiple populations, we need to consider at least two features: (1) how to incorporate any possible correlation among multiple populations to potentially improve point and interval forecast accuracy through multi-population joint modelling; (2) how to forecast multiple age distributions of death counts so that the forecasts are non-negative and have a constrained integral. To address these two issues, we introduce an extension of the compositional data analysis of Kokoszka, Miao, Petersen and Shang (2019, International Journal of Forecasting). Using the age-specific period life table death counts in Australia from 1921 to 2016 obtained from the Human Mortality Database (2020), we investigate 1-step-ahead to 20-step-ahead point and interval forecast accuracies of our models and make recommendations. The improved forecast accuracy of period life table death counts is of great interest to demographers for estimating survival probabilities and life expectancy, and to actuaries for determining temporary annuity prices for various ages and maturities.

    <td class = "title">Avoiding zero probability events when computing Value at Risk contributions<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
In this presentation I will discuss the process of risk allocation for a generic multivariate model when the risk measure is chosen as the Value-at-Risk (VaR). I will show how to recast the traditional Euler contributions from an expectation conditional to an event of zero probability to a ratio of conditional expectations, where both the numerator and the denominator's conditioning events have positive probability. For several different models we show empirically that the estimator using this novel representation has no perceivable bias and variance smaller than a standard estimator used in practice.

<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
In this talk, we study the asymptotic sub/super-additivity of Value-at-Risk under extreme-value copulas, when the marginal risks of the portfolio are identically distributed, which can be any one having a finite endpoint or belonging to one of the three maximum domains of attraction. We show that Value-at-Risk under extreme-value copulas is asymptotically subadditive for marginal risks with finite mean, but asymptotically superadditive for risks with infinite mean. Similar results will be discussed under the framework of Archimedean copulas in which the underlying variables need not be identically distributed.

    <td class = "title">Pandemic risk management: resources contingency planning and allocation

<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
Repeated history of pandemics such as SARS, H1N1, Ebola, Zika and COVID-19 have shown that pandemic risk is inevitable. Contingency planning is a necessary tool in the fight against pandemics. The extraordinary shortage of medical supplies in many parts of the world during the COVID-19 pandemic is attributable to the lack of coordinated efforts to build stockpiles and deploy existing resources rapidly to locations of greatest need. A combined strategy of contingency planning and resources allocation is a critical component of risk management for all organizations in the modern society.
Today's technology allows us to use epidemiological models to predict the spread of infectious diseases in the similar way that meteorological models are used to forecast weather. Taking advantage of predictive models, we can project the dynamics of demand and supply for medical resources at different phases of a pandemic. Such predictions provide quantitative bases for decision makers of healthcare system to understand the potential imbalance of supply and demand, and to address disparities of access to critical medical supply across different subsidiaries and in the course of the pandemic.
This talk extends the concepts of reserving and capital management in the classic insurance literature and aims to provide a quantitative framework for quantifying and assessing pandemic risk, and developing optimal strategies for resources stockpiling, emergency acquisition, and spatio-temporal resource allocations.

    <td class = "title">Time-Series Forecasting of Mortality Rates using Deep Learning
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
In this talk, we survey recent attempts to forecast mortality rates using deep neural networks and contrast several successful approaches. Building on these, we show how time series of mortality rates can be processed using neural networks that are specialized to deal with sequential data, such as recurrent and convolutional networks. We propose a relatively simple convolutional network model for forecasting mortality rates that can be interpreted as a generalization of the Lee–Carter model, allowing for its components to be evaluated in familiar terms. This model produces highly accurate forecasts on the Human Mortality Database, and, without further modification, generalizes well to the United States Mortality Database.

    <td class = "title">Joint Extremes in Temperature and Mortality: Bivariate POT Approach
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
This paper contributes to insurance risk management by modeling extreme climate risk and extreme mortality risk in an integrated manner via extreme value theory (EVT). We conduct an empirical study using monthly temperature and death data in the U.S., and find that the joint extremes in cold weather and old-age death counts exhibit the strongest level of dependence. Based on the estimated bivariate generalized Pareto distribution, we quantify the extremal dependence between death counts and temperature indexes. Methodologically, we employ the cutting edge multivariate peaks over threshold (POT) approach, which is readily applicable to a wide range of topics in extreme risk management.

    <td class = "title">A mixed bond and equity fund model for the valuation of segregated fund policies
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
Segregated fund and variable annuity policies are typically issued on mutual funds invested in both fixed income and equity asset classes. However, due to the lack of specialized models to represent the dynamics of fixed income fund returns, the literature has primarily focused on studying long-term investment guarantees on single-asset equity funds. This article develops a mixed bond and equity fund model in which the fund return is linked to movements of the yield curve. Theoretical motivation for our proposed specification is provided through an analogy with a portfolio of rolling horizon bonds. Moreover, basis risk between the portfolio return and its risk drivers is naturally incorporated into our framework. Numerical results show that the fit of our model to segregated fund data is adequate. Finally, the valuation of segregated fund policies is illustrated and it is found that the interest rate environment can have a substantial impact on guarantee costs.

<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
Using an online experimental survey we investigate how the willingness to pay for lifetime annuities is influenced by perceptions, information framing and real world institutional settings. We find that for those participants who are engaged with the experimental retirement benefit decisions, information provision can substantially reduce or eliminate behavioural drivers of the complex task of valuation of annuities. Providing balanced information and multiple opportunities to learn about the key features of the products, including the impact of potential outcomes, narrows the gap between the willingness to pay and willingness to accept, and offsets the effects information framing, real world institutional settings and low financial capability.

    <td class = "title">Generalized Log-Normal Chain-Ladder

<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
We propose an asymptotic theory for distribution forecasting from the log-normal chain-ladder model. The theory overcomes the difficulty of convoluting log-normal variables and takes estimation error into account. The results differ from that of the over-dispersed Poisson model and from the chain-ladder-based bootstrap. We embed the log-normal chain-ladder model in a class of infinitely divisible distributions called the generalized log-normal chain-ladder model. The asymptotic theory uses small σ asymptotics where the dimension of the reserving triangle is kept fixed while the standard deviation is assumed to decrease. The resulting asymptotic forecast distributions follow t distributions. The theory is supported by simulations and an empirical application.

I will also present an application of the chain-ladder to now-casting covid deaths in the English hospitals.

    <td class = "title">Reform proposals for occupational plans and state pension schemes.
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
The increase in longevity, the ultra-low interest rates and the guarantees associated to pension benefits have put significant strain on the pension industry. Consequently, insurers need to be in a financially sound position while offering satisfactory benefits to participants. First, we discuss a pension design (for occupational and private pension plans) where the traditional guarantees are replaced by low volatility, mainly achieved by collective smoothing algorithms and an adequate asset management. Applying some optimisation techniques on the key variables of the proposed pension product, we try to achieve both a satisfactory level of the initial pension and stable pension payments over time.
In the second part, we consider a reform idea for state pension schemes. The decreasing birth rates and increasing longevity threaten the sustainability of the public pension systems usually financed on a pay-as-you-go
(PAYG) basis, where current contributions cover current pension expenditure. We investigate a scheme where the deficit of the PAYG system is immediately covered by the state. However, in return the individuals need to invest an amount of money into a fund. This investment is designed so that the individuals can repay "their debt" to the state at a particular level of probability and at the same time expect a positive gain. Two different strategies of debt repayment depending on the amount invested and the timing of the repayment to the state are analysed and compared to the classical PAYG scheme.

    <td class = "title">On Risk-Sharing Games: Strategies, Gains and Winners
<br> <details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
<p>
The large majority of risk-sharing transactions involve only few counterparties. This implies that each of them could influence not only the design of the risk-sharing contracts, but also their prices.  In other words, in these transactions, agents possess the market power to impact both sharing and pricing. Depending on the nature of the risk-sharing, an agent’s strategic set of choices could be associated to questions like: How much risk should I share? How much risk averse should I appear? Which subjective beliefs should I reveal in the transaction?
Under oligopolistic risk-sharing settings, we establish some novel agents’ strategies based on the above questions that lead to different games among the risk-sharers. We then develop theoretical results on the induced Nash equilibria and compare them to the Pareto optimal ones. This comparison appears to have some common insightful features for all games. For example, Nash risk-sharing is different than the Pareto optimal one for any non-trivial situation and most importantly agents with relatively low risk aversion get higher gains in Nash than in Pareto equilibrium.
The talk aims to present the highlights of a related series of papers and state and discuss some open research problems.
