SUMMARY:[OWARS] Katja Hanewald (UNSW\, Sydney)
DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Katja Hanewald (UNSW) on "Long-term care insurance
  financing using home equity release: Evidence from an experimental
  study."\n\n\n\nAbstract: We explore new mechanisms to fund long-term
  care using housing wealth. We conduct and analyze an online experimental
  survey fielded to a representative sample of 1\,200 Chinese homeowners
  aged 45-64 to assess the potential demand for new financial products
  that allow individuals to access their housing wealth to buy long-term
  care insurance. We find that the stated demand for long-term care
  insurance increases when individuals can use housing wealth in addition
  to savings to purchase long-term care insurance. Individuals prefer to
  access housing wealth through a reverse mortgage loan rather than home
  reversion (a partial sale of housing wealth). Our results inform current
  policy reforms in China which aim at developing the private market for
  health and long-term care insurance products.\n\n\n
