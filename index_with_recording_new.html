  <b>Title:</b>
  Analytic Valuation of Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits<details>
<summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>
We exhibit and solve the partial differential equation that must be satisfied by Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits (GLWB) embedded in variable annuity contract when the benefit base for the withdrawals is the continuous running maximum of the fund (i.e. a ratchet GLWB) and the force of mortality is constant. We show that the fair fees are significantly higher in this case and highly sensitive to the withdrawal rate, risk-free rate, mortality rate and volatility. The value of the ratchet GLWB including fees is smaller when fund performance is poor and  larger when fund performance is good which may make these policies less desirable to risk-averse policyholders.
